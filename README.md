Python built budget tracker to help control expenditure on a month to month basis

Simple budget tracker to help curb overspending on a month to month basis. 
The idea is that, by tracking expenses and categorizing them into broad groups, areas of over expenditure can be identified and steps taken to mitigate costs incurred for non-essential items.
